This repo has a couple of additional Python files that might be handy.  The first is ``cg_solver.py`` which is a Python implementation of what we are trying to do with this assignment.  The second is ``mmgen.py`` which creates the `.mtx` files for us.  You might need to adjust the size of the matrices in ``mmgen.py`` depending on your needs.
